#planetLark
#first thing to do is echo the path the game is installed on and assign it to currPath=$(pwd);echo $currPath

#reset variables and files in the begining as well (or save) (maybe make a function to reset variables)
#use global variables for custom commands by the play (i think)
#$PS1 variable can be used to keep score(check PS1 options in the book)(like a HUD)(equal PS1 to the HUD)

#use functions to simplify and reuse code so they are easy to call 
#functions are all void, but you can do a psuedo return

#tput command can change color, emphasis, and cursor control (emphasize points)(this can be useful to make a terminal)

#use source to keep script  specific areas (ex:source ./functions.sh or ..functions.sh)
#dont worry about hiding values unless to prevent cheating (to hide:base64 file1)

#when you enter the explorable world, give them a menu of possible commands (you can add more possible commands to the menu as you explore the game, perhaps remind the player to check back at this menu as you progress)
#planetLark example uses:
#make a map of the spaceship perhaps? a map that adds places as you progress? 
#label items you can interact with with curly braces (ex:~door)
#label items you can pick up with(ex:+flashlight) (mv +flashlight $inventory)

#seperate ideas I came up with
#maybe you wake up trying to turn the engines back on and a generator back on
#vim editor puzzle
#use $PS1 variable to tell player where they are
#use a replicatable script for each room
#feed me seymour gmo plant room
#use echo to "talk" to AI controlled doors?
